# Viktor Synek's setup
You will find almost every information of my setups here, whether that's my OS, Settings, Code editor config, and so on.

## Operating System

- Let's start with the basics, I use Ubuntu 22.04 as my main Operating System - switched to it from Windows and never looked back, one of my best decision in terms of productivity especially, because I completely stopped playing video games.

- I do have Windows using VirtualBox, if I ever need it, but I won't talk about that at all, as I use it once every blue moon.

## Browser

For browser I use Firefox, with DuckDuckGo search engine. 

**Firefox Extensions:** 

- Unhook for Youtube to hide all the useless stuff like: Shorts, Explore, Trending, Video Sidebar.

- Dark Reader to force dark mode on pages - I set my contrast to +50 to give fully black #000 background.

- uBlock as my AdBlocker

- 7TV for Twitch emotes

## Terminal

- I use the default i3 terminal with tmux: ``i3-sensible-terminal -e tmux`` 

- I do have a lot of stuff downloaded via terminal, whether that's git, npm - which I won't list here as it contains a lot of stuff.
